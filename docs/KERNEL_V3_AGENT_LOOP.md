# Kernel v3 Agent Loop Notes

Kernel v3 is a host-owned single-agent harness. The model may propose,
evaluate, or synthesize, but the host validates policy, executes tools,
journals every transition, checks evidence, and decides when to stop.

## Current Loop

One agent task runs through this chain:

1. compile context from journal
2. planner proposes one `CandidateAction`
3. `PolicyGate` validates the action and tool manifest
4. `ToolRegistry` executes only allowed actions
5. evaluator returns feedback
6. `WorkloopEvaluator` derives progress, repetition, evidence sufficiency,
   and a host-owned termination decision
7. `StopController` and loop guards stop, continue, ask the user, or fail
8. final answer or failure report is journaled

`LoopControllerV3` remains tool-name-agnostic. Concrete flows such as
retrieval and workspace answering are configured by recipes, registries, and
operators outside the controller.

## Stop Semantics

The agent stops when one of these host-visible conditions is reached:

- sufficient evidence exists and evaluator feedback is terminal
- citations are required but missing and no allowed action can repair them
- the same action/query/path/observation/missing-evidence/failure repeats
- consecutive steps make no host-derived progress
- user input is required
- policy or resource guards block continuation
- loop limits are reached: steps, tool calls, network fetches, artifact bytes,
  or duration

Model feedback is never the only stop authority. It is combined with host
progress signals, repetition detection, evidence checks, and loop guards.

## Run Scope

Multi-turn and resumed tasks may share one task id, but each resume creates a
new run id. Runtime decisions that can affect completion are run-scoped:

- evidence sufficiency reads only current-run evidence, citations, and file
  observations
- retrieval and workspace finalization use only current-run grounding
- failure reports list current-run attempted actions, sources, missing
  evidence, and last observations
- repetition and no-progress counters are isolated per run
- recipe action ids are bound to the current run to avoid trace collisions

This prevents a later failed resume from completing with stale evidence from an
earlier successful run.

## Iteration 2026-05-31

Hardening completed in this iteration:

- blocked model `semantic.intake.response_hint` from becoming a final answer
- made repetition and no-progress detection run-scoped
- made evidence sufficiency and finalization grounding run-scoped
- made failure report attempt/observation summaries run-scoped
- bound recipe action ids to run ids
- added regression tests for stale retrieval evidence, stale workspace file
  reads, and semantic-intake answer leakage
